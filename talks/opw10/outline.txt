Google - A summer of Code
 - What is it?
 - WHo does it?
 - How do I get in?
 - My Project
  * Getting Started
  - Familiarizing myself with the code
  - SVN? Fun!
  - SVN? I Broke it
  - SVN? Ok I fixed it, but I really hate you
  - Finally developing.  Well. Sorta. 
  - Finding out about yak shaving, in all its glory.
  - Again, SVN I hate you (no, SVK does *not* work as a happy medium between SVN and git either) 
  - Tests pass, wait, my code works?
  - More tests pass, finally getting into a groove
  - All tests pass, stage one complete! ...10 More to go.
  - Next up: Design Chats (So wait, you want the doodad to go and talk to the thingy? Right?)
  - RFC on next steps (some feedback, mostly "wow, we got no feedback")
  - Drafting up a prototype
  - Writing some tests, getting reviews/feedback
  - Finally committing to one direction and developing on it
  - Iteration after iteration, finally completing another step
  - More design chats, moving a big faster now 
  - Realizing I've learned quite a lot since starting
  - Mentor check in.  Oh, I made the halfway deadline? Hot damn!
  - ...and back at step one, every single time we start a new phase!
  - write some code, test, test, test. write some code, test, test, test
  - stuff failing for other people!!!
   * fixing this stuff, why the hell did I change the port switch to -l?!
  - more tests
  - even more tests
  - dear God, is this Google Summer of Tests?
  - a few weeks left.  Wait. Two weeks. And shit, I have to do more tests!
  - really griding, am I going to get this finished?
  - homestretch, uh oh, x y and z aren't going to get done
  - testing, finalizing, and wrapping up before the deadline
  - final submission, hoping, praying I've passed
  - final reviews in, I passed!
  - Looking back:
   * Good Software is Never Complete
    - still involved
	- some frustration to get things out the door (I'm used to being yelled at by now :-) )
	- realizing I've done quite a bit, and we have a good base for the future
  - conclusion
   * future opportunities
   * networking
   * new skills
   * new frame of mind
   * many many many thanks.
