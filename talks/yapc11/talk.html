<ul>
  <li>
    <h3 id="what">What?</h3>
    <p>A simple method to delegate your long running processes away from your web applications for great justice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="who">Who?</h3>
    <p>Web app developers who are tired of waiting for Catalyst to finish processessing a request before moving on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
    <p>Because it&rsquo;s fun!  Also, decoupling of logic and processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="how">How?</h3>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s see!</p>
  </li>
</ul>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="follow-along">Follow Along?</h1>

<p>Before we get going, you may or may not want to check out the code from github.</p>

<p>To do so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>git clone git://github.com/dhoss/ThumbIt.git</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This code isn&rsquo;t 100% finished, but you are more than welcome to look at it to get an idea of where things go.</p>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="hi-shawn">HI SHAWN</h1>

<p>Hi.  And thanks for the VGA adaptor.</p>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="scenario">Scenario</h1>

<p>We have a website that takes image uploads of up to 4MB in size, any dimensions, and creates thumbnails for said images.</p>

<p>Simple enough, yes?</p>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="if-only">If only&hellip;</h1>

<p>Sure, if it&rsquo;s a small enough image.</p>

<p>What if it&rsquo;s 4MB in size though?</p>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="issues">Issues</h1>

<p>We run into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>slow processing times (have to wait until the application finishes processing the thumbnail <em>per request</em>, ouch)</li>
  <li>can&rsquo;t move on to other tasks until request is done (see above)</li>
  <li>huge hit on web app performance (even 25 or so people hitting the app at the same time to upload and thumbnail an image becomes a pain) </li>
</ul>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="solution">Solution?</h1>

<p>Delegate the thumbnail processing to POE workers using POEx::WorkerPool (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/POEx-WorkerPool/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/POEx-WorkerPool/</a>)</p>

<p>POEx::WorkerPool  allows you to set up a few things to make your job processing easier.  I&rsquo;m not going to go in depth here, nperez has a fine <a href="http://github.com/nperez/opw2010">talk</a> on that.</p>

<p>In short: </p>

<ul>
  <li>define a job to be done.</li>
  <li>define a class to be run in parallel</li>
  <li>instantiate your job class</li>
  <li>run application</li>
  <li>???</li>
  <li>profit!</li>
</ul>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="okay-but-where-does-catalyst-come-in">Okay, but where does Catalyst come in?</h1>

<p>We need an upload interface. Yes? Yes.  That&rsquo;s where Catalyst comes in.</p>

<p>Catalyst also writes out the initial image file to a directory that our POE workers will crawl through and create thumbnails out of.  </p>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="okay-how-do-these-two-interact-then">Okay, how do these two interact then?</h1>

<p>There are a few trains of thought here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>IPC</p>

    <p>Have Catalyst (through a model) talk to the POE app directly.
 This is okay, but can be cumbersome, and honestly, POE <em>inside</em> Catalyst is a little scary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our queue idea</p>

    <p>Queues are pretty awesome.  Whether maintained by an RDBMS, a flatfile, a simple directory, or an entire daemon, they seem to be a pretty rock solid method for dealing with multi-worker jobs.
We&rsquo;re going to go ahead and use a simple queue directory in the app hierarchy.  Anything in here will get processed into a thumbnail (enqueued), and once that done, that thumbnail will be written to the thumbnail directory and the image copied to the image directory and deleted from the queue directory.   </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="the-rundown">The rundown</h1>

<p>Workflow:</p>
<pre>
 user uploads image 
       |
       |
       v
 Catalyst does quick check to make sure it's &lt;=4MB
       |
       |                                            
       v                                            
       &lt;=4MB?                                       |----&gt; return to upload page with error, etc.
      /    \                                        |
    yes     no --------------------------------------
     |
     v 
 Catalyst writes said image out to queue directory 
       |
       |
       v
 Catalyst adds this job to the worker queue (simple database in our case)
       |
       |---------------&gt; Ajax begins poll of job progress --- &lt;-------------------- report back
       |                                                      |                       |
       v                                                      |                       |
  POEx::WorkerPool picks up job                               |                       |
       |                                                      |                       |
       |                                                      |                       |
       v                                                      |                       |
  POEx::WorkerPool starts up jobs (4 in this case)         &lt;--- Done? [ ] y  [x] n ---
       |                                                      |                       ^
       |                                                      |                       |
       v                                                      |                       |
  Workers churn out thumb nails   &lt;---------------------------- Done? [ ] y  [x] n---- 
       |                                                                              ^
       |                                                                              |
       v                                                                              |
  Workers finish, update queue    &lt;---------------------------- Done? [x] y [ ] n ---- 
|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|                  
                  THIS ENTIRE TIME CATALYST CAN BE PROCESSING OTHER REQUESTS
   ( you can even do something like set a default picture until the thumbnail is processed
                    if you anticipate that kind of wait time )
</pre>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="wait--what-just-happened">Wait.  What just happened?</h1>

<p>Essentially, Catalyst takes care of handing of the image to POE, and goes off and does some stuff.  A little bit of Ajax, and we have a longpoll bit that can update the status on the processing progress of this or these thumbnails.<br />
In some scenarios, you may just want to let the app go on with its merry business and not worry about the Ajax updating.  The point is, Catalyst is freed up to do whatever while POE works away.</p>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="cool--but-why-cant-i-just-use-a-cronjob-for-this">Cool!  But why can&rsquo;t I just use a cronjob for this?</h1>

<p>There are a multitude of reasons a cron job may not work in this instance.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The job takes too long, and runs over into the next schedule instantiation of the cronjob.</li>
  <li>Too much work to start up and kill a process, creating unnecessary load.</li>
  <li>Much harder to track progress in a cron job.<br />
POEx::WorkerPool allows you to check up on it much easier than an instance script in a cronjob might.
(here, we can just do $self-&gt;pool()-&gt;halt();)</li>
</ul>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="well-wait-what-about-x-it-does-y">Well wait! What about $x? It does $y!</h1>

<p>Yes, there ARE other options out there.  Here are a few examples!</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gearman - distributed/remote processing and function dispatching.</li>
  <li>TheSchwartz - a reliable job queue</li>
  <li>Coro - &ldquo;the only real threads in perl&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>While each of these have their own purpose, I feel they aren&rsquo;t suitable in this situation because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We don&rsquo;t necessarily need to scale OUT with machines in our case.  We want a local, easy to use, worker pool.  We don&rsquo;t need a farm of workers on a massive scale (at this point).</li>
  <li>We don&rsquo;t need a very robust queue system right now, and if we did, we&rsquo;d probably go with <a href="http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/">beanstalk</a> because it&rsquo;s pretty easy in terms of scaling up and out.</li>
  <li>POE is a long standing, well supported, tested, and extremely functional object environment.  It scales to the moon and back, and is actively and freely developed upon by many many very good perl programmers.  Not to say Coro or AnyEvent are any less good, but in this case, my preference lands with POE for functionality over speed.</li>
</ul>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="so--you--say-this-is-good-but-does-anyone-actually-do-this">So, -you- say this is good. But does anyone actually <em>do</em> this?</h1>

<p>Sites like github, Flickr, Canonical Cloud, Twitter, and <a href="http://highscalability.com/display/Search?searchQuery=job+queue&amp;moduleId=4876569">many more</a></p>

<p>Job queues and worker processes are a Good Thing.  Long running processes should be dealt without side of the web app.  It helps you have a single point of failure for each bit of logic.  It also allows you to farm out processes from other applications without having to load up your web application unnecesarily.  </p>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="where-else-is-this-used">Where else is this used?</h1>

<p>Common cases for this include sending email newsletters out, log parsing, creating git repositories, etc.</p>



</div><div class='slide'>

<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts?</h1>

<p>As said before, this is a cool idea.  Sure, there are drawbacks (do I <em>need</em> distributed processes? Do I need a cluster and remote jobs?), but this is a quick and really clean method to get more &ldquo;hands&rdquo; on your jobs to get stuff done faster.</p>
